          <p> October 2017 - Get energized and enthusiastic at the October 5 full moon. Attract a new friend or lover who is willing to make a minor sacrifice or go out of his or her way for your benefit and pleasure. On October 11, the Mars-Saturn square could bring a hidden disagreement to light. Avoid fury but stand firm. Love and romance shine bright with the new moon on October 19. Be at your most attractive and seductive. A very passionate - and practical - romance could be in your near future. A clever word said at just the right moment may be what signals an approaching new love.

          <p> Aquarius-born are shy and quiet , but on the other hand they can be eccentric and energetic. However, in both cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others. They are able to see without prejudice, on both sides, which makes them people who can easily solve problems.
          Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius-born have a deep need to be some time alone and away from everything, in order to restore power. People born under the Aquarius sign, look at the world as a place full of possibilities.Aquarius is an air sign, and as such, uses his mind at every opportunity. If there is no mental stimulation, they are bored and lack a motivation to achieve the best result.</p>
